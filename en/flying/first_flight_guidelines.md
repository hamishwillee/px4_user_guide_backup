# First Flight

## Selecting the Right Location

Selecting the right location for your first flight is critical. It can
make all the difference between a great level of gratification and
frustration.

The main things to look for:

- Make sure the space is open. No high trees, hills or buildings next
  to it, because it will impair the GPS reception
- Make sure no people are within 100 m / 300 feet
- Make sure there is nothing that you shouldn't crash onto within 100
  m / 300 feet: No houses, structures, cars, water, corn fields (hard
  to find drones in)

## Bring a Pro

If this is the first flight of a new drone or your first flight, bring
someone with experience. Let them help you to run through the pre-flight
checks and intervene if things go wrong.

## Planning the Flight

Plan the flight before taking off. Make sure to know where the vehicle
should go first, where it will continue its flight and from which
direction and how it will land.

## Limit the Damage

Loosing a drone might seem expensive, but damaging property or worse,
injuring people, has significantly more grave consequences. If you feel
you are loosing control and you're flying outside of the safe zone or
even further than you can see the vehicle, try to bring it back. If that
fails, crash it as fast as possible so it doesn't continue its journey.

## Arm the Drone

To arm the drone, put the throttle stick in the bottom right corner.
This will start the propellers on a multicopter. To disarm, put the
throttle stick in the bottom left corner. Alternatively arming and
disarming can also be performed in QGroundControl (PX4 does not require
a radio control for flying autonomously).
